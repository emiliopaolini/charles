**What would you like to see in CNL?**

Describe the feature you think is missing.

(This doesn't have to be a new definition or API, but anything about CNL which
is missing such as docs or platform support.)

**What are you trying to do?**

For context it might help to explain what you're trying to achieve.

**What environment are you working in?**

What compiler, operating system, project version etc.?
This might help provide some context.
It is also helpful information for understanding who CNL's users are.

**What, if any, instructions are you following?**

Before you thought to ask this question,
what source(s) of information -- if any -- were you following?
